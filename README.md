# java-basic-bank-account-creator
It holds a user ID, a user name, a balance, and you can also withdraw and deposit.
-------------
It's a very basic system, took me a few hours to make since I'm still learning Java.
It was one of the first small projects from this udemy classes I'm taking that I thought it was worth posting here.
-------------
I added the change name feature because the professor said that the user name was one of the parts that should be
modifiable post the user first input, I figured I could add the feature instead of just letting a setter sitting there for no reason.
-------------
I thought of adding a loop so you can deposit and withdraw multiple times but since it is a very simple project I thought it wasn't worth the trouble.
